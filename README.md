# My competitive programming exercise

This repo is for my competitive programming exercises records.
- All exercises can be found in [Competitive Programming 4](https://cpbook.net/).
- Praise [Competitive Programming Helper](https://github.com/agrawal-d/cph/tree/main) for this rather clean and fresh flat file structure.
- Respect [virtual judge](https://vjudge.net), you can complete and record your  exercises for both UVA and Kattis here.
- Only codes will be uploaded, and `.cph` file will not since containing my own test cases.
- NOT VERY OPTIMIZED CODE
